What are Uid and Gid? 

%

As you might expect, uid is a number associated with a user account and gid is a number associated with a group. The root user and group are usually given uid and gid 0. The IDs from 1-99 are also reserved for use by other system accounts.

In the /etc/passwd file the uid is the 3rd field and the gid is the 4th.
